In this term, I plan to build a ARPG game, which may be similar to Dark Souls/ Blood Borne. Players can control their characters to do many things, such as moving, attacking, defending and resting. 

In my project, Besides normal gameplay functions, I will create rigidity, blocking, parrying and dodging status for character and monsters. I believe it will make my game more realistic.

Moreover, I will complete more system to make my game better. For example, I will build buff system, inventory items system, and skill system and so on. However, I always believe a game without clever monster is boring. Thus, I plan to add some AI on the monsters in my game.
